# Learning Data Structures

This repository is dedicated to my journey of mastering data structures, primarily through the LinkedIn Learning course: Programming Foundations: Data Structures.

I will update the Python files with code and comments as I progress through the course and gather more information.

The goal is to solidify my understanding of fundamental data structures and their applications through practical implementation in Python.

## Repository Contents
Each topic covered in the course will have a dedicated Python file for implementation and experimentation. Here's an overview of the topics explored so far:
- **Arrays**
- **Dictionaries**
- **Sets**
- **Queues**
- **Stacks**
- **Programming Basics Glossary**

## How to Use This Repo
Each Python file is named according to the data structure it explores. You can run these files individually to see the implementation of different operations on these data structures.

Once the repository is cloned to your workspace, navigate to the directory containing the files. If the files are intended to be directly executable (with a shebang line like `#!/usr/bin/env python3` at the top), use:
- `chmod +x <file_name>`
- `./<file_name>`

Otherwise, run them with:
- `python3 <file_name>`

## Contributions
I'm open to feedback and contributions! If you have suggestions for improvements, additional implementations, or even new topics to explore, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.

Thank you in advance! :)
